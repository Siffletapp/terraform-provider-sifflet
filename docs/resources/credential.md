# sifflet_credential (Resource)

Credentials are used to store secret source connection information, such as username, passwords, service account keys, or API tokens

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sifflet_credential" "example" {
  name        = "credentialid"
  description = "Credential description."
  # Due to API limitations, Terraform can't detect changes to the value that are made outside of Terraform.
  value = "Credential value"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the credential. Must only contain alphanumeric characters. Must be uniquein the Sifflet instance.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the credential.
- `value` (String, Sensitive) The value of the credential. Due to API limitations, Terraform can't detect changes to this value made outside of Terraform. Mandatory when asking Terraform to create the resource; otherwise, if the resource is imported or was created during a previous apply, this value is optional.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Due to API limitations, Terraform can't detect changes on imported credentials.
# Importing a credential will always generate a diff during the first apply, even
# if the configrued value is the same as the imported one.
terraform import sifflet_credential.example 'credentialname'
```
