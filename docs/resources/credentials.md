## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the credentials. Must only contain alphanumeric characters. Must be unique in the Sifflet instance.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the credentials.
- `value` (String, Sensitive) The value of the credentials. Due to API limitations, Terraform can't detect changes to this value made outside of Terraform. Mandatory when asking Terraform to create the resource; otherwise, if the resource is imported or was created during a previous apply, this value is optional.
